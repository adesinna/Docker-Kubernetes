Controllers are the monitors kubernetes objects and respond accordingly.


When a pod  fails, the Replication controller replaces it, it maintains the number of required pods.

Replication controller they act has load balancer and scaling to maintain the pressure.

Replica set is the upgrade of replication controller

replication controller:

    kubectl create -f rc-definition.yaml

    kubectl get replicationcontroller # to see the number of optimal pods

    kubectl get pods # to see the pods it created in the node

replica set

    kubectl create -f rs-definition.yaml

    kubectl get replicaset

    kubectl get pods

    kubectl delete replicaset name

    Note:
        Replica set ensures the label is used to choose the ones you need

        if you change something in the manifest file

        kubectl replace -f rs-definition.yaml
