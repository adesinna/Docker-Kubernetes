A pod is a box where the containers are deployed, the pod lives inside the node

One pod usually contains a container, there might be many pods in a node but each pod only runs one single
container.

There are some scenario that a helper container might be in the pod, they are not the main container, but they
are only there to help, they are peripheral containers. The two containers will share the same network.


kubectl run nginx --image=nginx # it pulls down the image from dockerhub

kubectl get pods

kubectl describe pod nginx # this gives you more information about the pods

kubectl get pods -o wide # additional information
