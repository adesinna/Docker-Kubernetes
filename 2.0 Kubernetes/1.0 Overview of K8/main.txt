Container Orchestration:
    Managing containers is done by kubernetes.


K8 Architecture:
    Node:
        A node is a machine (physical or virtual) on which kubernetes is installed and where container
        will be launched.

    Cluster:
        This is a set of nodes grouped together, and they are all controlled by the master nodes.

    Components:

        API server:
            Acts as the front end, where you can interact with k8 cluster

        etcd:
            This is a key value pair storage, that stores all the information about the nodes

        scheduler:
            It is responsible for distributing work across the nodes.

        controllers:
            The brings ups new containers and nodes when one goes down

        container runtime:
            This is the container engine where the container runs

        kubelet:
            It makes sure the container are running as expected.




    Master vs Slave worker:
        Worker nodes are where the containers are hosted
